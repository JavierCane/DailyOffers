Disclaimer
------------------

This is a project for a college subject which only evaluates the app UX, and in spite of my initial intention,
the application is not finished at this moment yet, so I decided to make it public.

Among other technical "refactor candidates", it's parsing a hardcoded JSON file inside the
application package, but I can ensure you that I can sleep :)
